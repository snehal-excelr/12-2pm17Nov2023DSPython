        "How to build an NLP pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "Step1: Sentence Segmentation\n",
        "Sentence Segment is the first step for building the NLP pipeline. It breaks the paragraph into separate sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step2: Word Tokenization\n",
        "Word Tokenizer is used to break the sentence into separate words or tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step3: Stemming\n",
        "Stemming is used to normalize words into its base form or root form. For example, celebrates, celebrated and celebrating, all these words are originated with a single root word \"celebrate.\" The big problem with stemming is that sometimes it produces the root word which may not have any meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 4: Lemmatization\n",
        "Lemmatization is quite similar to the Stemming. It is used to group different inflected forms of the word, called Lemma. The main difference between Stemming and lemmatization is that it produces the root word, which has a meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 5: Identifying Stop Words\n",
        "In English, there are a lot of words that appear very frequently like \"is\", \"and\", \"the\", and \"a\". NLP pipelines will flag these words as stop words. Stop words might be filtered out before doing any statistical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 6: Dependency Parsing\n",
        "Dependency Parsing is used to find that how all the words in the sentence are related to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 7: POS tags\n",
        "POS stands for parts of speech, which includes Noun, verb, adverb, and Adjective. It indicates that how a word functions with its meaning as well as grammatically within the sentences. A word has one or more parts of speech based on the context in which it is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 8: Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of detecting the named entity such as person name, movie name, organization name, or location.\n",
